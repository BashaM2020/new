# Solving problems :) with objects
# programming models, combination of code blocks
# (OOP) object-oriented programming, is a model to code, as seen in Ruby 
# all codes have the code of C(functional programming model) 
# Functional programming, very hard to understand for beginers
# OOP is more relatable and easier for beginers to learn
#
#Everything in oop is defined by a Classes  and Objects 
# 
# Objects (is a defined entity), (charachteristics define it/ anything you can give its state(how it looks) and behavior/functions ex: a car, window, bank account, zebra)
# Objects= 1)state/features/charachteristics 2)behavior/ function what is does
# Objects have names. they are specific entities... animal is not a object, but dog is.
# Advantages of objects is that it dosent care about the details of how the objects works. just wants to know what it can or cant do
# behaviors of an object do the action- whichever action it is capable of
#
#Class
#is a template from which we create an object. 
#each object will be different and have the some different states and behaviors, but the same outline, generalized things, (
#(the object itself defines its value/ its specific state and behavior)!
#
#ex: class=CAT
#object1= this cat has 1)states=color 2)behaviors=eat, sleep, eat
#object2= this other cat has another state and similar behaviors
#class is an exisiting array from which we creat objects, 
#there cant be objects without the class
#
#OOP is defined by classes/ blueprints and objects/instince
#
# How do we get objects to do things?
# you direct them, if it can, it will, if not, ERROR
#
#
# Data Encapsulations
#
#states are always private, and can't access it- only thru its behavior
#behavior= method
#state= data (private)
#to get to a state u need to use a method
#   1] 
#enclassify objects= access data
#ur code is capusled- and you need a code to encapsule it
#your stated is defined by variables, u cant access those variables directly. u need a method to access those methods=
#this tecnique keeps those states protected as found in OOP. this property= data encapsulation
#you can modify charachteristics this is why its private, and prevent it from be exposed an effected by other codes
# inheritance...parent class, child class.. common properties of its sub class with objects can inherit the parent class
#
#   2]
#class inherits properties of another class
#it helps in code resuse, and flexibility in code resuse
#child properties defined in the parent class
#media class= child class- album -movie, these properites dont need to be defined in each, so just define it in the parent class
#
#   3]
#abstaction= process of hiding the process dedtails and showing the function to the user
#
#   4]
#polymorphasin= object takes on other forms
#done in a OOP model, method over-loading, methode over-ridding 
#method-over-loading= the method name is the same but the num of arguments is different, this determins which method to be invoked and affect the objects
#
#method-over-riding= having the same method, with slight modifications
#defing the same method of a parent class
#writting the method in a parent class and re-writting it in the child, this changes the property from its parents
#only possible in inheritance
